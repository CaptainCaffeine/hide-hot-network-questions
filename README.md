# hide-hot-network-questions
A greasemonkey script to disable the Hot Network Questions on StackExchange sites.

I did not make this: I found it somewhere on either Reddit or Stack Overflow, and I can't remember the author. In any 
case, it's a useful script to have around and so I'm going to host it here for easy access.
 
The script simply finds the hot-network-questions element on any StackExchange page and disables it. I have the
following in my included sites:

`https://*.stackexchange.com/*`

`https://stackoverflow.com/*`

`https://superuser.com/*`

`https://askubuntu.com/*`

`https://mathoverflow.com/*`

`https://serverfault.com/*`
